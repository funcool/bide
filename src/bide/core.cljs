;; --- Browser History Binding API

(defn start!
  "Starts the bide routing handling using the `goog.history.Html5History` API as
  browser history event watching mechanism.

  Accepts router and configuration map. Required configuration keys are
  `:on-navigate` and `:default`. `:on-navigate` is a function that would be
  called each time route is changed providing route id, params and query as
  arguments. `:default` used as default route id when URL doesn't match any
  route registered in router. Optional configuration keys are `:html5?` (`false`
  by default) and `:html5history` (new `goog.history.Html5History` instance by
  default). Passing anything that evaluates to logical false as value of
  `:html5?` would configure history to use fragment to store token. Pass factory
  function that returns instance of `goog.history.Html5History` to
  `:html5history` when you need to do some customizations to history instance
  used to manage history events."
